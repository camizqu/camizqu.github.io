At Novari, I worked in an Agile environment to perform Quality Assurance on a new product my team was developing. I used tools like JMeter and Selenium to conduct automated testing, while also doing complete manual testing.

I also completed a proof of concept to migrate a developer tool to the cloud. This involved Microsoft Visual Studio, where I coded in C++ and used .NET framework.
