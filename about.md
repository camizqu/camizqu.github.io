About Me

Hi! My name's Camila, and I just graduated from Queen's University with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, Software Systems. You can see my involvement and past work experience [here](https://camizqu.github.io/experience.html)!

Apart from my technical passions, I love listening to music. Currently my top track on Spotify is Location by Burna Boy. I also love attending concerts and do so frequently! The last concert I attended was The 1975 in Toronto.

Another one of my passions is Formula 1.
